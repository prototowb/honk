# PROJECT STATUS — Social Publishing Mission Control (SPMC)

> Single source of truth for project state.

## Current State

```yaml
project_phase: "Beta-Prep"
project_name: "Social Publishing Mission Control (SPMC)"
framework: "MCP server + Claude skills"
project_type: "AI-native social publishing plugin"
initialization_date: "2026-06-10"
current_sprint: "Beta-Prep"
version: "0.3.0-alpha"
```

## Sprint Beta-Prep — Complete (non-UI capabilities)

Goal: Expand capabilities toward a versatile, near-beta state — content
intelligence, safety/observability, and a real test suite — without starting
any UI work. Branch: `feature/BETA-001-capability-expansion`.

Outcome: tool surface 15 → 23, all new tools credential-free and verified by
37 unit tests + a 12-check MCP smoke test. Live credential testing remains
deferred by decision; live-path adapters (publishing, analytics) are unchanged
or only additively extended.

## Active Tickets

**None — nothing in progress or pending.** BETA-010 (live credential testing) and
BETA-012 (carousel + branded slides + account_info + media-host backup) shipped
this session (`v0.3.0-alpha`); see *Completed*. The only remaining item is the
UI implementation planning stop-line (BETA-011), which still needs an explicit
user go-ahead (see *Next Up*).

## Recent Updates

- 2026-06-17: **BETA-010 live test executed + BETA-012 features shipped (`v0.3.0-alpha`).** Published a real, researched 6-slide Instagram carousel (US gov pulling Anthropic's Fable 5 / Mythos 5) to `@protocode_` + a Facebook Page post, end-to-end through the spine. New product surface: IG carousel publishing (`instagram_post` `image_urls[]`), `account_info` read tool, `square-news` branded slide template (handle + circular-icon footer, body word-wrap), imgbb-primary/Cloudinary-fallback selection with `CLOUDINARY_URL` one-liner parsing. Live testing surfaced + fixed real issues: **FB analytics metrics were all-deprecated** (`post_impressions*` → engagement metrics, verified valid live), a `compose` empty-value bug that blanked the accent/handle, an expired FB token, an invalid imgbb key, and the unparsed Cloudinary one-liner (last three resolved by user-supplied creds). Verified live: IG+FB publish, IG analytics, audit, rate-limits, profile reads. 41 unit tests + smoke + `build:check` green. **Uncommitted on a feature branch pending push.**
- 2026-06-16: BUILD-001 single-origin — **SHIPPED + MERGED to `main` (v0.2.0-alpha), pushed, CI green.** Wire-up + merge-back closed it out: CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) + opt-in pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, no husky) both run `build:check`; `hermes/mcp-config.json` excluded from `--check` (machine-local absolute path = environment, shape still template-checked); `.env.example` single-origined as a `credentialEnvKeys()` completeness assertion; design folded into `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BUILD_CONCEPT.md` reduced to a pointer; version single-sourced + bumped to `0.2.0-alpha`. Merged `--no-ff` (`f401b44`) and pushed `main` to `origin/honk`. First CI run caught a latent test-glob bug (quoted `node --test` glob needs Node ≥21; CI's Node 20 couldn't expand it) — unquoted so the shell expands it; next run green (`build:check` 20 checked + 1 skipped, 38 tests, smoke). **No active tickets; next = the deferred stop-lines (live cred testing / UI planning), awaiting user go-ahead.**
- 2026-06-16: BUILD-001 single-origin — **slice B2** (the final slice): `skills/*` (13) + `hermes/SKILLS.md` are now generated from a hand-authored `capabilities/` prose tree. New token resolver (`{{limit:…}}` / `{{unit:…}}` / `{{tool:…}}`, 1:1 specs object-path, build-failing on any bad token) single-sources platform limits + tool names into prose. `output-manager` body reconciled (dropped queue/scheduling overlap with `manage-queue`). Generator now emits **21 artifacts**; `build:check` green, 38 tests + smoke pass. The single-origin build system is complete — remaining work is CI/pre-commit wire-up + merge-back (no slices left).
- 2026-06-16: BUILD-001 single-origin — slice C (one SPMC plugin: content-pipeline absorbed, 13 skills, dead trees removed) + slice B1 (tool tables injected into README + Hermes CONTEXT) + slice A (all 3 MCP configs rendered from one template; 17 credential keys single-sourced via `lib/config.js`). Generator emits **7 artifacts**; `build:check` green, 38 tests + smoke pass. Remaining: B2 (skills ← capabilities), then CI wire-up + merge-back.
- 2026-06-14: Beta-Prep sprint — tool surface 15 → 23, content intelligence + audit + observability + tests; dispatcher unified (scheduler account bug fixed). UI work intentionally not started.
- 2026-06-14: Alpha-1 packaged — npm package, Claude Code plugin, README, git init
- 2026-06-10: Media pipeline shipped (ALPHA-003)
- 2026-06-10: MVP shipped — MCP server live, all tools verified, configs ready
