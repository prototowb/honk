# SPMC — Project Architecture

> Extracted from PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS.md. Authoritative architecture reference.

## System Overview

SPMC is an MCP server + skills bundle. There is no UI at MVP. The agent is the interface.

```

```

## Design Decisions

### Adapter pattern
Each platform lives in one file with named exports matching their semantic action (`post`, `postSingleTweet`, `postThread`, `postVideo`, `checkStatus`, and the additive `getMetrics`). Adding a new platform = add one adapter + one skill + one case in the dispatcher + one entry in `lib/specs.js`.

### Single dispatcher + hook point (Beta-Prep)
`lib/dispatch.js` is the one place that routes a `(platform, content, account)` to the right adapter. `index.js` and the scheduler both import it — previously each had its own copy and they had diverged (the scheduler dropped `account`, so scheduled multi-account posts published from the default account). `publishAudited()` wraps `publish()` with audit logging and rate-limit recording, so every publish path — direct tool, `queue_dispatch`, scheduler — produces one durable record. Summaries are formatted in the dispatcher, not per-caller.

### Validation as a verifiable substitute for live testing
`lib/specs.js` is the single source of truth for platform constraints; `lib/validate.js` checks payloads against it. `dry_run` runs validation and previews routing without calling any platform API. This exercises the full server path (validation → formatting → dispatch routing) with zero credentials — the safety net used while live credential testing is deferred.

### Agent-first content intelligence
`content_adapt` does only the deterministic residue (counting, grapheme-aware truncation, thread-splitting). The creative rewrite (tone, hashtags, per-channel voice) stays with the calling agent. Similarly, `scheduled_at` is normalized to absolute UTC rather than parsed from natural language — the agent already knows the current time. A timezone-less timestamp is accepted as server-local (correct for the local single-user server) but warned, since it would be ambiguous once hosted/multi-tenant.

### Unverified scaffolds, clearly marked
`lib/analytics.js` + adapter `getMetrics` and `lib/ratelimit.js` depend on live API behavior that has not been exercised. They are built (store, routing, tools) but labeled unverified in code and docs; the automatic backoff queue is intentionally not built yet.

### File-backed queue
`queue/store.js` uses a `queue.json` file in the same directory. Simple, portable, zero dependencies. Upgrade path: swap `store.js` for a SQLite-backed version in Phase 1; the interface is stable.

### Credentials
All secrets are env vars. The MCP server reads `process.env.*` at call time. Never stored in queue items or passed through tools. Claude Desktop injects them via the `env` block in `claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Tool surface
23 tools (Beta-Prep): 8 publishing/status + 5 content-intelligence (`content_validate`, `content_adapt`, `config_doctor`, `audit_log`, `schedule_check`) + 5 queue + 3 observability (`rate_limits`, `analytics_fetch`, `analytics_report`) + 2 media. The queue is intentionally decoupled from publishing — agents can queue and validate without credentials and dispatch when ready.

## Agent Integration Points

| Agent environment | Integration method |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Claude Code | Skills in `skills/` directory |
| Claude Desktop App | `claude_desktop_config.json` mcpServers entry |
| Cursor / Windsurf | Same MCP config, different host config file location |
| Hermes | Reads AGENTS.md + uses MCP tools directly |
| Any MCP-compatible agent | `node spmc-server/index.js` via stdio |

## Phase 1 additions (post-MVP, do not build yet)

- Multi-account support: namespace env vars per account (e.g. `X_API_KEY_PERSONAL`, `X_API_KEY_BRAND`)
- SQLite queue with scheduling daemon
- Media pipeline: local file → CDN → public URL
- Analytics ingestion tools
